# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Super Sudoku

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will be a website that radnomly generates Sudoku boards that can be played repeatedly and cna be at variying difficulties for players to interact with. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will be executed through Python and IDLE  because it is the programming that we are the most comfortable with. My software will include a game board that we have to create  and a random number generator that puts them into specific cells. The software will have to understand how the game works and that there can only be one of each number per square, row, and column. The program will have to allow users to select cells input numbers that are between 1-9 and reject incorrect numbers and invalid inputs. we would also like to inlcude an error counter, and some sort of celebration when the user beats the game. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The outcome of a good final project will include a finalized website with a running randomly generated sudoku board that can be played repeatedly.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome of a final project include a finalized website with a running randomly generated sudoku board that can be played repeatedly, as well as randomly generated boards with varying levels on difficulty for the players to choose from and a error counter.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome of a final project would include a finalized website with a running randomly generated sudoku board that can be played repeatedly, as well as randomly generated boards with varying levels on difficulty for the players to choose from. Also, the website will also include a celebration after completing the game, and randomly generated boards with varying designs.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn more about how users can input into a specific self determined location as well as getting the software to determine correct and incorrect inputs. I will need to research more about randomization, user input, and how to connect different parts of the program for example, how to get the program to recognize an error then tally it into an error box. This will require understanding many moving parts and I think there will be more challenges and more topics for us to research further. In reference to collaboration I assume we will both begin researching to both gain the knowledge needed for this project or we may split it up so one of us starts out by developing the board and completing some code we already know how to, and the other will begin research on the les familiar topics. We can shift back and forth from one working to the other person researching and vis versa.
