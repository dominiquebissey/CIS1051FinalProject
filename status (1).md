Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

For the project so far we have created the sudoku board and the playable sudoku game that accepts the the users manual number inputs, and addresses if the user's choice was corrrect or incorrect. We have also done the full sudoku game that the user can play and then reset and play again when the previous game is finshed. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have to create the super sudoku website that the game will be on, the aspect of the sudoku games having varying difficulties that the players can choose from, and the end celebration when the user sucessfully completes the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We had encountered the problem of incorrect solutions not being caught when the inputs the user did were wrong, but we have since corrected this problem.
